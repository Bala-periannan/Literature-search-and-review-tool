## About This Project
This tool is being developed to streamline literature search, review, and article extraction, with a strong focus on biomedical and life sciences domains. While it initially supports PubMed, our long-term goal is to integrate with multiple platforms and sources of scientific literature to make literature management more accessible and efficient.

The project is in its early stages and will be updated frequently. We aim to build a fully functional and user-friendly tool that can assist researchers, healthcare professionals, and students in:

Searching academic literature by keyword, PMID, DOI, Keywords, Dates and country and many more filters

Downloading open-access articles (when available)

Managing and reviewing collected papers

Eventually integrating features like metadata parsing, tagging, annotation, and reference exports

## Development Timeline
‚úÖ July 2025 ‚Äì Project initiated, PubMed search prototype started

Ongoing ‚Äì Regular improvements, code optimization, and source integrations

### Current Requirement: 
I need assistance with downloading PDFs from PubMed.

## Future Plans:

Add support for Springer, CrossRef, Google Scholar, and more

PDF parser for extracting text and metadata
